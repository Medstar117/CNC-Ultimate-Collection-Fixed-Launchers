v1.01 - Bugfixes
  
  + Fixed a minor bug in the installer that makes the "Next" button on the game selection page always stay selectable,
    even when no game is selected
  
  + Updated information page to reflect new patch number; and updated the formatting a bit

  + Cleaned up installer page that shows what all is being installed; set it to where it'll just say which game
    is being updated and what patches are being installed instead of EVERY SINGLE ACTION being done

  + Added PARToolManager to automatically edit all .par files in a specified game directory (makes use of Ekey's EAPARTool)
    This also fixes the issue regarding German installations not being patched correctly

  + Fixed a .par-related bug that prevented Tiberian Twilight from starting

  + Added game-detection support for 32bit OS'es

  + Added ResEdit, which automatically edits the options.ini file for Generals and Zero Hour to use the primary monitor's
    native resolution--or it adds a new options.ini file with the correct resolution set if the file doesn't exist
    (fixes a crash-on-start error)

  + Fixed a bug that prevented the -modconfig parameter from working

  - Removed included .par files as they were deemed unneccessary due to PARToolManager being added
